## Description
This talk is about Python talks. I will pick 15-20 talks and examine them under various aspects.

## Abstract
If you are a Python developer, you cannot really complain about the sheer number of talks freely available on the internet. But you need time to watch them.

Some talks are great, masterpieces. If you listen to them and take notes, they can make you a better developer.

Some other talks are so-so. Maybe they are too short to give you a good understanding of a library/tool that you want to use, or of a concept that you want to master. Or maybe the talk itself is perfectly ok, but it's either too basic or too advanced for your current level of skills with Python.

I will pick a few talks that I particularly enjoyed, and examine them under various aspects. I will dedicate 1-2 slides for every talk that I pick, and I will try to answer the following questions for each one:

- Why do I think this talk is great?
- What did I learn by watching this talk?
- Are there similar - maybe better - talks on the same topic?
- Was this talk related to my field of expertise?
- Was this talk suited for my current level of skills in Python?
- Last but not least, did I enjoy this talk?
