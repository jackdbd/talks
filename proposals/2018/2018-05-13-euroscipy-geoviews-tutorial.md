## Description
In this tutorial we will explore geospatial data with GeoViews. We will start from geodata freely available on the internet and build an interactive visualization running in a Jupyter notebook.

## Abstract
Geospatial data is everywhere, and as Python developers, we can leverage a plethora of libraries to find it, analyze it, visualize it.
I will briefly mention the main providers of geospatial data and supply the files that we will be using during the tutorial (to avoid long download times).
We will create some geographical features, starting from the simplest ones, up to the most complex ones.
We will then combine data (geospatial and non-geopatial) from different sources to create an interactive visualization.
At the end, we will discuss some options on how to deploy our data visualization and maybe make a data product out of it.

## Pre-requisites
Some basic knowledge of pandas, matplotlib and bokeh.

## Objectives
- Learn where to get geospatial data
- Learn the basics of the GeoViews API
- Learn some terminology (shapefile, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, gridded dataset, choropleth map, etc...)
- Learn how to perform spatial joins with GeoPandas
- Learn how to create an interactive visualization

## Outline
- Setup the conda environment: 5m
- What is GeoViews? Its place in the Python data visualization ecosystem: 10m
- From a Natural Earth shapefile to a GeoViews visualization: 5m
- From any shapefile to a GeoViews visualization: 10m
- Visualizing GeoJSON and TopoJSON: 10m
- Let's visualize a gridded dataset: 10m
- Combining data: different GeoViews layers from different data sources: 15m
- Let's make a choropleth map: 10m
- Big data visualizations with Datashader: 10m
- Where to go from here: 5m

## Additional notes
I will provide a YAML file with the exact replica of the conda environment I will be using during the tutorial, so it should be easy to clone it and avoid running into dependency issues.
