## Description

Chromium-based browsers store your browsing history, bookmarks, and cookies, in a directory called User Data. This directory is located in your Chromium profile, and contains a few SQLite databases that we can freely access and analyze using SQL.

In this talk we will explore the Chromium User Data directory and will be able to answer questions like:

- What are the 10 websites you visited the most this month?
- Which files did you download this week?
- What kind of websites you visit during the day? How many times did you visit Reddit today?
- Which keywords did you type in the browser's address bar?
- Which cookies were set while you were browsing the internet? How many of them have a HttpOnly flag?
- When did you browser crash? Where did it report errors to?

Finally, we will discuss about the Chromium Disk Cache and showcase a few tools you can use to analyze it.



The goal of this talk is to provide an overview of Chromium’s browsing history management system and its implications for users. We will discuss the different types of data stored by Chromium browsers, how it is used, and potential strategies for managing it. In addition, we will explore the implications of this data for privacy and security. By the end of this talk, attendees should have a better understanding of how their browsing history is managed by Chromium browsers and what they can do to protect their privacy online.

This talk is intended for anyone interested in learning more about their online privacy and security. It is especially relevant to those who use Chromium browsers or are considering using them in the future. No prior knowledge or experience with web technologies is required; all that’s needed is an interest in learning more about how your data is managed online.
