## Description

When a web server sends an HTTP response to a browser, it includes a few key value pairs we call HTTP response headers. Some of these headers are crucial for web security and can protect your website / web app from attacks like XSS. They can also be used to ensure you are serving all of your pages / assets with HTTPS (i.e. you don't have mixed content issues).

In this talk we will discuss which HTTP response headers are important for web security, how they are configured, what's their current support across browsers, and which tools we can use to configure/troubleshoot these headers.
